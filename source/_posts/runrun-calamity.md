  {% bubble Rinne %}
    ...Now then. I need to go hit up a new game soon~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Wait just a second, Amagi. This conversation isn't over yet.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Just ask me when I get back. Listen, I can't afford to let today's winning luck slip me by. Sooo, I'll catch ya later Himerunrun!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    ...Good grief. Even when you do come back, the first thing you'll do is make a ruckus over what you're going to eat. Or actually, he used "Himerunrun" instead of "Merumeru", what was that? Why doesn't he just stop doing what he wants, not just with how he acts, but with what he calls others too--
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Mitsuru %}
    Jiii~[1]...
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    <th>*(...? Someone's gaze can be felt from the shadows...the one staring at HiMERU from just behind the hallway corner is Ra\*bits's...)*</th>

    Tenma Mitsuru. HiMERU knows you're there.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Mitsuru %}
    Whawhat?! I'm shocked you could tell!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Your entire upper body was visibly peeking out. If you really wanted to observe your target in secret, you would need to hide better. ...Why don’t you tell HiMERU what you wanted from him?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Mitsuru %}
    Sure thing! Heyhey, I thought "Himerunrun" was super cute! Because of that, could I call you "Himerunrun-senpai" too?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Firstly, why do you ask?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Mitsuru %}
    Because I thought it was cute?? Also I've been wondering what would be okay for me to call you since no one else around here has a name in English~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Is that so. Please call HiMERU as you normally would and use "HiMERU", Tenma.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Mitsuru %}
    Ehh~. I can't call someone older than me that! Nn...then, I'll call you "HiME-chan-senpai"! Okay?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    HiME-chan...it's uncomfortably odd, but it's alright. Since "Runrun" is too cheerful.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Mitsuru %}
    Really? It makes me feel like I'm skipping, and it really does make me feel cheerful so I like it! I wanna be "Mitsurunrun" too. So since HiME-chan-senpai is "Himerunun", I should be "Mitsurunrun" then, right?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Well, let's see. Since HiMERU's name ends in "--ru", we can guess that's the reason Amagi had given him the name. If we use that logic on you, Tenma, then it wouldn't be wrong to use "Mitsurunrun".
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Mitsuru %}
    Kyakya~! I got the "green light"! I'm gonna spend the whole entire day as "Mitsurunrun"! Instead of dashing home today, I think I'm gonna skip! Thanks, HiME-chan-senpai!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    <th>(...He sure did leave with a skip in his step. Besides that, how is he possibly going to spend his time as "Mitsurunrun"...?)</th>
  {% endbubble %}

  <div class="msr-narration">
    <p>The next day.</p>
  </div>

  {% bubble Wataru %}
    A quick step, skip, and jump onto your back! Hello~! Here's your very own Hibiki Wataru~...newly renamed "Watarunrun"~!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    <th>*--?!*</th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Wataru %}
    Ufufu, did I startle you? When I jumped, I overshot my momentum and went a little too far, didn't I?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    ...Hibiki-senpai, hello there. Did you need something from HiMERU?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Wataru %}
    Nooo? For today, I'm not "Hibiki-senpai", but "Watarunrun"~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Pardon?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Wataru %}
    Yesterday, I was able to run into Tenma-kun skipping happily down the hallway, but yesterday he was not Tenma-kun.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    He was "Mitsurunrun"...?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Wataru %}
    Correct\~! You're a genius, "Himerunrun"-san\~. And so, as someone whose name also ends with "--ru", I followed his lead and became "Watarunrun"!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    <th>*(That kind of logic isn't wrong.)*</th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Wataru %}
    And because I became "Watarunrun", Subaru-kun also became "Subarunrun"~. We had a really fun time in our dorm room last night. I tried calling Butler-san "Yuzurunrun" to initiate him into our group, but he refused with a beaming smile yknow?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    <th>*(Of course he would, who would want to involve themselves in something like this.)*</th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Wataru %}
    How are you feeling, "Himerunrun"-san? Does your heart flutter whenever you're called "Himerunrun"?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Um, no. HiMERU's chest doesn't flutter, and HiMERU's name is "HiMERU", so please continue to use that. HiMERU is nothing but "HiMERU", so there will be trouble if other names are used.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Wataru %}
    Fumu, is that so? From an actor's perspective, it's a great pleasure to treasure the relationships formed with each role~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    <th>*(Nothing about it seems pleasurable, but HiMERU will leave it at that. Remaining in Seisou Hall will only make it more likely to run into more people. It would be better to go somewhere to relax...)*</th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    .........
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaoru %}
    .........
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    <th>*(Even if this was just some sort of coincidence, this outcome of people is way too ridiculous. HiMERU has the feeling the other person is trying to escape too.)*</th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaoru %}
    Ahaha...sorry for getting all defensive, Hi-"Himerunrun"-kun. I was just thinking how hard it must be for you, so I didn't know how to come up with a greeting.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Hakaze-senpai, even you know about that name floating around.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaoru %}
    Well, last night they turned me into "Kaorunrun". I had to be a part of it or else I'd look like the loner that can't read the room, right?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    That's not any of HiMERU's fault, but apologies for getting caught up in it anyway. HiMERU will get to the bottom of this and also talk to the person that started it...
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaoru %}
    ?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Oh, it's Merumeru! Are you here for lunch? Isn't it late for that? Well, I'm having lunch right now too. Whatcha eating Merumeru, hayashi rice[2]? If it's good, then I'll order it too. Gimme a bite~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Don't try to take a bite without asking. Anyway, you used "Merumeru" today. HiMERU thought Amagi only used it once and that was it.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Nn? Merumeru has always been Merumeru, hasn't he? That is to say, since you paid so much attention to it that means Merumeru has approved of the name "Merumeru", right\~? Y'know, you've been reeeaaal quiet about it these past few days. I'd say you like it\~.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    This is only because it's a choice out of a very few amount of options. So don't get carried away with it. HiMERU is HiMERU. In the future please refrain from adding any additional ridiculous names.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    You say that, but I was actually thinking that it's time for a new name. Just to shake things up?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    That's not it! ...Anyway, to avoid any and all unnecessary trouble, Merumeru is fine. Just Merumeru. Seriously, why is it that you try to take amusement in HiMERU? It'd be better not treating it like a joke.
  {% endbubble %}

### Translation notes:

**[1]:** The japanese onomatopoeia for "staaaare", when a character is staring intently at another, like they have something to say.

**[2]:** This is a dish where there's rice with a sauce containing beef and a few vegetables are poured on top.
TL Note: I'm sorry if the HiMERU dialogue sounded stiff :’) This was my first time trying my hand at tling a HiMERU centered story it was hard for tense/perspective understanding but overall good practice :3
